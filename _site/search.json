Therefore, this dataset is ideal for data analyst to practice creating visualization and analyzing data. The website mentions income data by race over time, those who are interested in economic conditions and social issues are also the potential audiences.\n\n\nOriginal Data\nThe data comes from the Urban Institute and the US Census. The Urban Institute provided nine charts about racial wealth inequality in America(“Nine Charts about Wealth Inequality in America” 2017). The US Census provided historical income tables that have been joined to compare wealth and income over time by race(“Historical Income Tables: Households” n.d.).\nI downloaded this dataset from here. You can also download this dataset using “tidytuesdayR” package(Community 2023).\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\nYou can also find the data dictionary here\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nyear\nYear\n\n\nrace\nRacial Group\n\n\nnumber\nNumber of households\n\n\nincome_median\nIncome median\n\n\nincome_med_moe\nIncome median margin of error\n\n\nincome_mean\nIncome mean\n\n\nincome_mean_moe\nIncome mean margin of error\n\n\nincome_bracket\nIncome bracket (9 total brackets between &lt;$15,000 and &gt;$200,000\n\n\nincome_distribution\nIncome distribution as the percentage of each year/racial group - should add up to 100 for a specific year and race.\n\n\n\n\n#load data\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.2 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.3.0      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.4      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nincome_distribution &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/income_distribution.csv')\n\nRows: 2916 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): race, income_bracket\ndbl (7): year, number, income_median, income_med_moe, income_mean, income_me...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\nData wrangling using dplyr\n\nincome_distribution_by_year_race &lt;- group_by(income_distribution, year, race) %&gt;%\n  summarise(income_mean = mean(income_mean)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(income_mean), !is.na(year), !is.na(race))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'.

The line plot illustrates a substantial increase in mean income over time for all racial categories. The box plot reveals significant income disparities among the groups, with Asian and White races typically having higher income means than Black and Hispanic groups, which is consistent with the finding in this paper(Center 2016). Finally, the bar chart demonstrates a shift towards higher income brackets over the decades, suggesting an overall increase in wealth among all races. Together, these visuals indicates the existence of income inequality and the progress made from 1967 to 2019.\n\n\nFunction used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nFunction\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\ngroup_by(), summarise(), filter(), mutate(), select()\n\n\nggplot2\ngeom_line(), geom_boxplot(), geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCenter, Pew Research. 2016. “1.
