### Question

I tried to use this dataset to identify the change of income in America over time and compare the differences of income mean between different races.

### Intended Audience

The data is from TidyTuesday, which aims to involves datasets being shared for R users to apply their skills in data wrangling and data visualization[@tidytuesday]. Therefore, this dataset is ideal for data analyst to practice creating visualization and analyzing data. The website mentions income data by race over time, those who are interested in economic conditions and social issues are also the potential audiences.


### Original Data

The data comes from the Urban Institute and the US Census. The Urban Institute provided nine charts about racial wealth inequality in America[@urbanwealthinequality]. The US Census provided historical income tables that have been joined to compare wealth and income over time by race[@censusincome].

I downloaded this dataset from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/income_distribution.csv). You can also download this dataset using "tidytuesdayR" package[@tidytuesday].

```{r}
#load data
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)


income_distribution <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/income_distribution.csv')


```

### Data wrangling using dplyr

```{r}

income_distribution_by_year_race <- group_by(income_distribution, year, race) %>%
  summarise(income_mean = mean(income_mean)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(income_mean), !is.na(year), !is.na(race))

income_by_year <- filter(income_distribution, race == "All Races")  %>%
  mutate(income_bracket = factor(income_bracket, 
                                 levels = c("Under $15,000","$15,000 to $24,999", "$25,000 to $34,999", "$35,000 to $49,999", "$50,000 to $74,999",   
                                            "$75,000 to $99,999", "$100,000 to $149,999", "$150,000 to $199,999", "$200,000 and over"))) %>%
  select(year, race, number, income_bracket, income_distribution)

### Plot

```{r, fig.dim=c(10, 8)}

income_distribution_by_year_race  %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = income_mean, color = race)) +
  theme_bw(base_family = "Times") +
  labs(
    x = "year",
    y = "Income mean",
    title = "Line plot of income mean by race over time",
    caption = "Jiayi Xue",
    subtitle = "Substantial Growth in Mean Income Across Racial Groups from 1967 to 2019",

        axis.title = element_text(size = 15),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 13),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14))


```

::: column-margin
The results appear to have some level of duplicate data for "Asian Alone" and "Asian Alone or in Combination" since the dataset was created by combining some raw data from different sources. We are not changing the dataset to avoid breaking old code, but you may want to start from the raw data if you are using this for anything important.

```{r, fig.dim=c(10,8)}

income_distribution %>%
  filter(!is.na(race), !is.na(income_mean)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = race, y = income_mean, color = race)) +
  theme_bw(base_family = "Times") +

### Bar chart

Given the extensive range of years, it's impractical to visualize each one individually. To manage this, I've sampled data at five-year intervals, starting from 1967, which allows for a comprehensive yet concise visual representation of trends over time.
:::

```{r, fig.dim=c(12, 10)}

income_by_year %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(from = 1967, to = 2019, by = 5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = income_bracket, y = income_distribution)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 3, scales = "free") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Times") +
  labs(
    x = "Income Bracket",
    y = "Income distribution(in percentage)",
    title = "Bar chart of income distribution of all races in each year",
    subtitle = "As time progresses, there is a noticeable shift towards higher income brackets.",
    caption = "Jiayi Xue"
  ) +
  theme(
        plot.title =  element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 40, size = 9, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 15),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))

```

### Summary

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of income distribution across different racial groups in the United States from 1967 to 2019. The line plot illustrates a substantial increase in mean income over time for all racial categories. The box plot reveals significant income disparities among the groups, with Asian and White races typically having higher income means than Black and Hispanic groups, which is consistent with the finding in this paper[@pewresearch2016demographics]. Finally, the bar chart demonstrates a shift towards higher income brackets over the decades, suggesting an overall increase in wealth among all races. Together, these visuals indicates the existence of income inequality and the progress made from 1967 to 2019.
